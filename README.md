# project3_nodejs_mongodb

I made this project as part of a Udemy course on Node.js and MongoDB. The purpose of the website is to allow the user to upload details about different campgrounds which are saved on a MongoDB database. The user can choose to then browse through these campgrounds or use the search function to find a specific campground. 

Note that this is not the full project as I was not able to upload all of the source code necessary to allow NodeJS to run properly (NodeJS code is used but NodeJS is not installed in the workspace)

This website is not hosted anywhere but the code is available.
