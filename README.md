# project3_nodejs_mongodb

I made this project as part of a Udemy course on Node.js and MongoDB. The purpose of the website is to allow the user to upload details about different campgrounds which are saved on a MongoDB database. The user can choose to then browse through these campgrounds or use the search function to find a specific campground. 

This website is not hosted anywhere but the code is available.
